# Stage 2: Metadata-rich local build

This stage adds a customized "otangle" and friends that emit code with comments
and information about symbolic constants. You can look for updates to
`../stage1/exports/otangle.c` from stage1 to see if there are any changes that
need to be ported into `tectonic-otangle.c`.
